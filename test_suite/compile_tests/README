The source code modules in this directory are intended
for checking the compiler's ability to parse the
source, rather than to check for the proper execution
of compiler output.  The test script compiles the source
and checks the return code from the compiler.  The
test.script file identifies which programs should
return 0 or return non-zero.

When adding tests to this directory, add an entry
into the test.script with the program base name
followed by a colon then T, F or W.  A 'T' indi-
cates that the compiler should return a 0, a 'F'
indicates a non-zero failure code, and a 'W'
indicates that the compiler should return with
compiler warnings.

A sucessful test is a T that compiles clean, a F
that fails to compile, or a W that returns an
error status.
