SYNOPSIS
htcobrun [options] program-name [command-line-parms]

DESCRIPTION
Load and run programs defined in modules.
A module is a shared library (DLL) which can contain one or more 
programs (function in C).

The current version of only supports called programs which do NOT have 
any parameters. Meaning a PROCEDURE DIVISION without a USING parameters clause
in COBOL.   
Any command line parameters (arg1...argN) passed to the called program can be 
retrieved using the ACCEPT verb in COBOL.

The called 'program-name' is independent of the module (library) name. 
Duplicate module names can exist. In such cases which program name is loaded
is dependent on the search path.

OPTIONS

-V     Display version information and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and TCOB_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Define the module (shared libraries, DLL) search paths.
The default search path is the current working directory.
