Beginning with version 0.65, TC will use the VB-ISAM [1] library, version 2,
for all indexed file IO.

VB-ISAM is not usually included by any UN*X distribution, but it can be built from
sources found on the TC download web pages [2]. 


1) VB-ISAM - version 1 only
http://sourceforge.net/projects/vbisam

2) TinyCOBOL - VB-ISAM version 2
