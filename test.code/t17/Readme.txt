Test code for the following:
- ACCEPT FROM command line, 
- ACCEPT FROM environment variables. 
- Set RETURN-CODE variable.

Notes:
The functionality for command line and environment variables
has been enhanced and simplified.

The old sample code is obsolete and no longer functional.
 
To run type(example):
./test17 'aa b c' 1234567890 e ff
