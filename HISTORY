Hi fellow hacker!
 
This is not a full-featured product, but rather historic sources of my own tool: 
a COBOL compiler I have done from scratch and found it floating around my 
"spare parts" box.  It may be useful as a skeleton for a new project, or just a 
grab bag of ideas for your own work.

This is supposed to work with my "HandTerm" and "MT-100" micro-terminals, some
hardware projects I used to manufacture some years ago¸ but it's not produced
anymore.

I wouldn't even try to compile this sources again, because it's so dependent on
the environment (micro-terminal, msdos, and specific C compiler) and I don't
remember how to make all things go smooth. Please don't ask me how to remake
this.

Included there is a full compiler (almost ANSI 76 compliant, if I remember
well), the runtime library, and a nice source-level debugger written mostly in
prolog.  When compiled and linked, the object is a TSR (Terminate and Stay
Resident) program for msdos.

This is released as GPL/LGPL licensed. Please see the enclose files COPYING COPYING.LIB.

I hope you enjoy.
