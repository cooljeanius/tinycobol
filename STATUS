The TinyCOBOL Project STATUS:

TinyCOBOL supports the x86-32 (IA32) architecture and the following platforms.

- Linux using the GNU compiler tool chain.
- FreeBSD using the GNU compiler tool chain.
- Win32 using the MinGW (Mingw32) GNU compiler tool chain.  
- Win32 using the Cygwin GNU compiler tool chain and Cygwin POSIX emulation layer.

Currently the compiler will generate GNU assembler code. With the aid 
of GNU assembler and linker, a executable binary can be created to run
on the above mentioned x86-32 (IA32) platforms.

The compiler will work with COBOL sources which are in standard fixed 
column or X/Open free form formats. A conversion utility to convert fixed
to free form COBOL source code is included in all sources.

The term COBOL 85 standard, as used by TinyCOBOL, refers to the combination
of the following.
- ISO 1985.........: Programming Languages - COBOL.
- ISO 1989-1.......: Programming Languages - Intrinsic Function Module - COBOL.
- ANSI X3.23-1985..: Programming Languages - COBOL.
- ANSI X3.23a-1989.: Programming Languages - Intrinsic Function Module - COBOL.
- X/Open XPG3......: COBOL programming languages extensions.

Note that the 'COBOL 85 standard' is obsolete and has been replaced by the 
'COBOL 2002 standard'.

The current released snapshot has support for the following features and/or 
COBOL syntax.

- ACCEPT, DISPLAY (including stdin, stderr, stdout).
- ACCEPT, DISPLAY.
  Line I/O (stdin, stderr, stdout).
  Screen I/O (non COBOL 85 standard extension).
  at LINE ... POSITION ... (non COBOL 85 standard extension).
- CALL (including dynamic load).
  BY REFERENCE. 
  BY VALUE. 
  BY CONTENT.
  RETURNING variable (non COBOL 85 standard extension).
- CHAIN (non COBOL 85 standard extension).
- CURRENCY SIGN, DECIMAL-POINT. 
- Debugging facility using GDB (not fully functional).
- Embedded SQL using vendor supplied SQL pre-processor.
- External variables.
- EVALUATE. 
- File I/O.
  Includes OPEN, CLOSE, DELETE, READ, WRITE, REWRITE, START
  READ .. WITH LOCK  (not functional)
  READ .. WITH IGNORE LOCK  (not functional)
  Variable record length file IO.
  Locking for relative files.
- Floating point types (USAGE IS [ FLOAT-LONG | COMP-2 | FLOAT-SHORT | COMP-1 ]).
- GO TO, GO TO ... DEPENDING ON.
- GOBACK (non COBOL 85 standard extension).

  Supports free and fixed syntax formats.
  Supports all COPY statements including the REPLACING clause.
  The REPLACE statements are not implemented.
- Intrinsic Functions.
- Linux extensions (return code, command line, environmental variables).
- Math verbs (including [NOT] ON SIZE ERROR options).
  ADD (including CORRESPONDING option). 
  COMPUTE (+ - * / ** operators implemented). 
  DIVIDE.
  MULTIPLY. 
  SUBTRACT (including CORRESPONDING option).

- Sequence of source programs.
- SCREEN SECTION (COBOL 2002 draft standard).
- SET.
- STRING (Not all options are implemented).
- SORT, RELEASE, RETURN. 
  USING and GIVING clauses only work on sequential files. 
  The sort work file is kept in memory and not written to disk.
- SEARCH.

- SELECT ... ASSIGN (not all options are implemented).
  Supports non-standard external file name assignment in SELECT and FD statements.
- Static variables.
- TRACE, READY/RESET (preliminary).
- UNSTRING.
- UNLOCK (not functional).
- Variable length (1, 2, 4, 8) support for BINARY, COMP, COMP-5 fields.
- Variable record length file IO.
- Variable size arrays.

The following features and/or COBOL syntax are currently under development.

- CORRESPONDING options in the MOVE, ADD, SUBTRACT statements (preliminary).
- DEBUG lines.
- EXTERNAL semantics (preliminary).
- Inline comments (2002 draft standard).
- Intrinsic Functions (preliminary).
- PROCEDURE DIVISION DECLARATIVES (preliminary).
- The REPORT SECTION (preliminary).
- Variable size arrays.

The following features and/or COBOL syntax are not currently supported:

- Any portion of the COMMUNICATION SECTION.
- Non native IA32 types (big-endian).
- Support for 33 digit precision for temporary variables in RTS.
- Nested sequence of source programs.

The following features and/or COBOL syntax are not likely to ever be 
supported.
