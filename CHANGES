Note: This list is NOT up of date.

November 29, 1999 (Andrew)
Added code to fileio.c to return the correct ANSI 74 Error codes
for files that are accessed but not open etc.

November 25, 1999 (Andrew)
Change fileio.c for write advancing.
Change htcobgen.c for write advancing.

November 25, 1999 (Rildo)
Modified again the copy...replace list of replacements, so that all
replacements are appended only when switching the input file. (scan.l)

November 23, 1999 (Andrew)
Fixed up rewrite for relative files.
Added code for write advancing.

November 24, 1999 (Rildo)
Modified YY_INPUT and added several functions to do the preprocessing online
for the "copy" statement. The source is now yyin to be better flex compatible.

November 23, 1999 (Rildo)
Fixed install and lookup functions for non-ASCII literals (high/low values).
Update "move" at the library to cope with quoted literals \0 and \xXX.

November 22, 1999 (Andrew)
Change htcobgen.c (gen_rewrite) to handle relative rewrites.
Change fileio.c to handle rewrite.

November 21, 1999 (Rildo)
Changes in picture processing (P assumes V).
Introduction of a variable decimal_comma in compile-time and run-time
to swap '.' and ',' interpretation.

November 20, 1999 (Rildo)
Applied changes at the "main" suggested by Glen, regarding file names.
Implemented "ALL literal" at the parser,scanner,codegen and library (mcmove.c),
with just small changes at this last, function "move". Also, high-values,
low-values, quotes.

November 19, 1999 (Andrew)
Added routine for "rewrite" to fileio.c. Cleaned up the code to remove
compile warnings.

November 18, 1999 (Rildo)
Added several functions to manage multi-subscripted variables, including
relative references.

November 15, 1999 (Rildo)
Merged with Andrew's changes.
Changed lookup_var (htcobgen.c) to make sure a field is fully qualified.

November 15, 1999 (Andrew)
Added code to fileio.c to allow read and write to handle line sequential io.

November 15, 1999 (Rildo)
Added "varying" clause to "perform".
Corrected my mistake on the syntax of "perform".
Changed "perform_range" to be better generalized (with/without "thru"). Now
inherited attributes hold what kind of perform to do.

November 14, 1999 (Andrew)
Finished off the first version of the sort routines. These routines handle
duplicate keys.  I have also added some of the code to the library for
read next. All changes have been made to fileio.c.

November 13, 1999 (Rildo)
Changed "lookup_label" and added a forced-cloning option to "install".
Update listing generator (htcobgen.c) for the cloned paragraphs,
and also to accommodate the (compound) variable names.
Added "perform var/literal times paragraph_range" to our syntax. Now we can see
why we don't need to backtrack!
Routines added to htcobgen.c: gen_push_int, gen_perform_times, merged with the
previous semantics of perform.

November 12, 1999 (Rildo)
Added more states to the scanner for accounting to redefined variables and
file variables (FD or SD). 
Modified (again) "install" (htcobgen.c) to avoid cloning when not desired.

November 12, 1999. (v991111): (David Essex)
Moved termios.h header to basicio.c file, to avoid any potential ECHO 
redefinition.
Enhanced INSTALL instructions, and renamed Readme.txt file to README.
Changed output of scanner(scan.l) very slightly to have \n at end.
Changed Makefile so that htversion.h is created using directory name
and current date, instead of Version.txt file.

November 11, 1999 (v991111a): (Rildo)
Added code (htcobgen.c) to take care of clones both for variables and
paragraphs.
Modified parsing to accept "var of parent of ...".
Started implementing of "inspect".

November 11, 1999. (v991111): (David Essex)
Changed working storage fields parsing(htcobol.y), and added implicit
variable index creation code(htcobgen.c), so that 'INDEXED BY index'
clause will work.
Added error counter(on yerror()) which is used by htcobgen.c to set
the return code. This enables make to work properly.
Added the ability to use a full name when calling the compiler. Now
htcobol will try to open filename, then try filename.cob before aborting.


November 06, 1999 (Rildo)
Modified scan/parse to detect already defined variables (token VARIABLE). Now
labels, literals and variables are separate entities.

November 05, 1999 (Andrew)
Modified the sort_release in fileio.c to handle a combination of Ascending
and Descending sort keys.

November 04, 1999 (Rildo)
Modified hash() (htcobgen.c) to calculate the hashing with uppercased chars.
Modified code for the lookup of reserved words, for not buffering and
converting the string being tested (strcasecmp is used instead).
Added states to scan.l to simplify the parsing of all commenting statements
of the identification division. Now everything (except environment division
decl) is ignored.
The variable curr_division is used now in the parser to switch states of the
lexer (parser feedback).

November 04, 1999 (Rildo)
Eliminated VALUES state (scan.l) and some general simplifying.
Corrected a bug with LABELSTR recognizing (if use "-" should be followed by at
least another char).

November 03, 1999 (Rildo)
All functions named XXX_from and XXX_into are similar with their suffix-less
counterparts. Example cob_read_into == cob_read, cob_write_from == cob_write,
and so on. In place of the record pointer, there will be a buffer pointer.

November 02, 1999 (Rildo)
Modified gen_cobwrite (htcobgen.c) so that for both "write" and "write from"
the same "call cob_write" is output, changing only the arguments.
Merged with last release of Andrew.

November 02, 1999 (Andrew)
Written the basic Sort Library (fileio.c)
Provided test program t08 to test the sort library.
Sort with Duplicates still needs to be completed.

October 30, 1999 (Rildo)
Moved file description generation to the end of data division, so we can
use a variable as filename container. Only cob_open runtime was changed to
accommodate such modification. Now there is a list (files_list) that accumulates
all file variables.
Eliminated old debug code and all o_deb references (htcobol.y, htcobgen.c),
including all line_info() calls.
Added stack frame cleaning (auto-magically) functions (htcobgen.c), and also
push_eax and push_ebx to use instead of writing directly to o_src. This should
make more error prone our code generation.

October 30, 1999 (Andrew)
Started sort routines (fileio.c)
Modified htcobgen.c for sort commands. (?I think?)

October 29, 1999 (Rildo)
Eliminated struct var_fd and moved open_mode to struct file_desc.
Now file functions receive a pointer to the record itself.
Sequential files save the file handle into dbp (instead of a db pointer).
All state information (only needed in indexed and relative files) are
saved at the libdb structs now.

October 28, 1999 (Rildo)
Modified string recognizer in scan.l to allow 1-char strings.
Eliminated call_list in htcobgen.c (used to gen externals).
Corrected the syntax for filenames (now is in select statement, see t06).
Added cob_read, cob_write for relative files.
Fixed gen_write (htcobgen.c) for relative files.

October 27, 1999. (v991027): (David Essex)
Added fix for lower case input in lex scanner(scan.l).
Added code for version number (Makefile htcobgen.c htversion.h).
Moved basic I/O routines from general.c to basicio.c file.
Added SP fix in gen_accept function (htcobgen.c). 
Added function definitions and removed includes in (htcoblib.h).
Added fix for USAGE IS in lex scanner(scan.l).
Changed input file name and Makefile in directory test.code/tdb01. For some 
reason, my version of GCC(2.7.2) refused to compile it with the file name main.c.


October 26, 1999: (Rildo Pragana)
Changed all file functions to "cob_", to avoid name clashes.
Removed RUNNING-TERMINALS clause from both parser and scanner.
Corrected wrong label at gen_not (htcobgen.c).
Eliminated "short" expressions in "jmp short L%d" (htcobgen.c).

October 24, 1999 (Rildo):
Removed all debugging compilation, as this was for an old prolog-based debugger
and the tracking of ip locations is hard to do now, because of .align
instructions. Instead, we should use gdb with #line directives.
Modified several miscalculated stack cleaning instructions (addl $n,%esp).
Modified function calling: each parameter required is passed as two pointers,
(1) the fld_desc of the parameter and (2) the parameter storage.
Added file handling routines (yet unfinished): mc_open, mc_write, mc_close,
save_status.
Added a picture expand routine (mc_picexpand) in the library.

October 23, 1999: 
Added ACCEPT function in RTL(basicio.c).
Added fix to remove comma as decimal delimiter in lex scanner(scan.l).

October 22, 1999: 

October 21, 1999: 
Changed run header info in (htcobgen.c).
Added cobpp program utility in util directory. It will convert from 
fixed to/from free-form COBOL formats.
Added new fix for program flow control at stop-run(htcobgen.c).
Added Rildo Pragana's fix for program flow control(htcobgen.c mccntrl.s).
Added fix for for period/comma in PIC and VALUE in lex scanner(scan.l).

October 19, 1999: 
Removed .fill and other junk at end. 
Added id section. Removed prg-id as main label and replaced with main.
Added Rildo Pragana's indexed file I/O source in test.code/t04 directory. 

October 18, 1999: 
Make some small changes in lex scanner(scan.l), while checking COPY code.


October 13, 1999: 
Merged David Essex's and Andrew Cameron's versions, using Andrew Cameron 
October 12, 1999 release as a base.
Added code(htcobgen.c) for return code. Program return code is stored in 
register %eax. Since COBOL-74 does not support the statement RETURN-CODE, 
the program return code is permanently set to zero.
Added fix for for comment line (^"*".*$) in lex scanner(scan.l).

October 12, 1999: 
Andrew Cameron releases his latest version.
Added math functions to lib. Started on file functions.

October 11, 1999: 
Andrew Cameron releases his latest version, based on Alan Cox's June 23, 1999 
version. 
Added new basic I/O functions in RTL. Removed ncurses as basic I/O.

October 3, 1999: 
David Essex begins new version.
Changed COBOL generation to look like GCC assembler generation(htcobgen.c).
Enhanced debugging information for assembler in COBOL generation(htcobgen.c).
Added fix for for PIC with VALUE in lex scanner(scan.l).
Started work on process control.

September 23, 1999: 
Alan Cox releases his latest version to David Essex.

June 23, 1999: 
Alan Cox, releases his changes. It now generates GNU GAS assembler.

June 11, 1999: 
Rildo Pragana, releases his COBOL compiler (for msdos) under the GPL.
