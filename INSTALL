TinyCOBOL is a COBOL compiler being actively developed by members of the 
free software community.

The long term goal is to produce a COBOL compiler which is 'COBOL 85 standard'
compliant, or at least as close as reasonably possible.

TinyCOBOL supports the x86-32 (IA32) architecture and the following platforms.

- Linux using the GNU compiler tool chain.
- FreeBSD using the GNU compiler tool chain.
- Win32 using the MinGW (Mingw32) GNU compiler tool chain.  
- Win32 using the Cygwin GNU compiler tool chain and Cygwin POSIX emulation layer.

See 'Readme.mingw32.txt' for information on the MinGW (Mingw32) Win32 platforms.
See 'Readme.cygwin.txt' for information on the Cygwin Win32 platforms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release Notes: Linux, FreeBSD and most x86-32 POSIX compatible systems.

TinyCOBOL only supports x86-32 platforms. 
There are no plans to support the x86-64 platforms.

Record and file lock are not currently implemented.

Berkeley's DB library (versions 1.85 - 4.6 using the 1.85 compatibility API) is 
used for indexed file IO and the SORT run-time functions.
As of version 0.64, the indexed file format has changed and is incompatible
with previous TinyCOBOL indexed file format versions. 
Note that BDB database file formats can be incompatible between BDB versions.

How to build TinyCOBOL from the source code:

Before you start, check the prerequisites listed at end of this section.

Download source file and extract archive.
Configure the sources to your system.
Edit and change 'htconfig.h' if necessary (optional).
Edit and change the compiler defaults file 'htcobolrc' (optional).
Build and install the binaries.
Set environment variables 'TCOB_OPTIONS_PATH' and 'TCOB_RTCONFIG_PATH' (optional).

Example:
./configure --prefix=/usr (... add as required)
make
make install (su access required)


Type 'make clean' to remove the built binaries.
Type 'make distclean' to remove the built binaries, make files and configure setup. 

configure options: (./configure --help)
...
Optional Features:
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
  --enable-debug          set C compiler debug option on -g
  --enable-debug-all      enable all debug options
  --enable-debug-comp     enable compiler and scanner debug options
  --enable-debug-compiler enable compiler debug option
  --enable-debug-scanner  enable scanner debug option
  --enable-debug-rts      enable debug Run-Time option
  --enable-debug-rts-move enable debug Run-Time Move routines option
  --enable-debug-pp       enable debug pre-processor option
  --enable-mfcomp         enable MF compatibility features
  --enable-test-mode      enable Test Mode features
  --enable-shared=ARG     build shared libraries (default=yes)
  --enable-static=ARG     build static libraries (default=yes)
Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --with-C-compiler=ARG   use C compiler (default=gcc)
  --with-lex=ARG          use LEX (default=flex)
  --with-yacc=ARG         use YACC (default=bison)
  --with-readline         use readline library
  --with-libdb=ARG        use DB library versions 1.85-4.6 (ARG=1,2,3,4)
  --with-cobf2f           build and install format conversion utility (cobf2f)
  --with-dash-redefine=ARG Set the dash ('-') transformation characters (default=_2D)


Configure notes:

Berkeley's DB library (BDB verions 1.85 - 4.6) is used for indexed file IO and 
the SORT run-time functions.
Due to the number of BDB naming combinations, the configure script may fail to 
configure TinyCOBOL. 
If the normal configure fails to properly detect Berkeley's lib DB on 
your system, try the following option.
#./configure --with-libdb=ARG where (ARG=1,2,3,4)
If the '--with-libdb=ARG' option fails to properly detect and setup BDB
on your system, then some temporary links may be used to circumvent this problem.
Example:
#ln -s libdb1.so.xx libdb.so
#ln -s db1/db.h db.h
#./configure --with-libdb=ARG where (ARG=1,2,3,4)

The ''--enable-debug-comp' configure option will enable the compiler trace 
information generated by the compiler, and used to debug the compiler itself.
It will not effect compiler debug option '-D', which adds debugging data to 
the generated binary.
Unless you are a developer, or are planning to debug the compiler itself, or 
like to look at substantial amounts of trace data, it is recommended that the 
above configure option be omitted.

Prerequisites and requirements (also see configure and release notes):
To build TinyCOBOL requires the following to be installed on your system.

- GCC tool chain (GCC, AS, LD). 
  The TC compiler generates GAS compatible assembler code for the x86-32 (IA32) platform.
  The final compilation and linkage is done indirectly by GCC.
- make (make).
- LEX (flex). 
- YACC (Bison or Berkeley's YACC version 1.9.3).
  Note that Berkeley's YACC version 1.9.3 (byacc) can be downloaded only from 
  the TC 'snapshot' web page. Previous versions of Berkeley's YACC may not work. 
- Berkeley's DB [1 2] library (BDB verions 1.85 - 4.6). 
  Required for the COBOL SORT verb file I/O.
- Curses library (ncurses).
  Required by the SCREEN SECTION and some types of DISPLAY/ACCEPT statements.
- VB-ISAM library version 2.0. 
  Required for indexed file I/O.

The readline library version is optional.

Miscellaneous:
Some test programs can be found in 'test.code' directory.

Regression test suite sources can be found in 'test_suite' directory.

The utils directory contains some utility programs.
The cobf2f program (converts to/from fixed and free-form COBOL formats) is not installed by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment variables:
TCOB_OPTIONS_PATH, TCOB_RTCONFIG_PATH, TCOB_LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The 'TCOB_OPTIONS_PATH' environment variable set the directory where the compiler 
options file 'htcobolrc' can be found.

The 'TCOB_RTCONFIG_PATH' environment variable set the directory where the run-time 
options file 'htrtconf' can be found.

The 'TCOB_LD_LIBRARY_PATH' and 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variables set the 
shared libraries (DLLs) search path directories.
