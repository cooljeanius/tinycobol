TinyCOBOL is a COBOL compiler being actively developed by members of the 
free software community.

The long term goal is to produce a COBOL compiler which is 'COBOL 85 standard'
compliant, or at least as close as reasonably possible.

TinyCOBOL supports the x86-32 (IA32) architecture and the following platforms.
- Linux using the GNU compiler tool chain.
- FreeBSD using the GNU compiler tool chain.
- Win32 using the MinGW (Mingw32) GNU compiler tool chain.  
- Win32 using the Cygwin GNU compiler tool chain and Cygwin POSIX emulation layer.

The TC compiler generates GAS compatible assembler code for the x86-32 (IA32) platform.
The final compilation and linkage is done indirectly by GCC.

The project is approaching the first beta release with many statements 
already implemented.

test suite.

Support for the CHAIN, GOBACK statements, BLANK WHEN ZERO, 
INITIAL (preliminary), SPECIAL-NAMES (preliminary) clauses,

the GCC options.

Preliminary support for the Win32 (native, no emulation layer required)
platform using the MinGW (Mingw32) tool chain. 

A set of utilities have been added to enable TC testing 
for COBOL standard compatibility using the NIST test suite.

General notes:
Bison is the default parser, Berkeley's YACC (byacc) version 1.9.3
is now an option.
The configure script will now handle multiple versions library DB and
C compilers depending on the options selected.

Important note:
Effective with version 0.56, the command line options have been changed
to more closely reflect the GCC options.

The default action when no appropriate command line option is given,
defaults to 'x', create an executable (pre-process, compile, assemble and link). 

Previous version defaulted to 'S', generate assembler code (pre-process, compile).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.55:
This release contains mainly bugs fixes, and enhancements.  
It includes updates to the main compiler, run-time,

will require Berkeley's YACC (byacc) version 1.9.3 or Bison.
Version 1.9.3 of YACC (byacc), only available on the snapshots web 
page, has been modified to handle huge grammars such as COBOL.
Using previous versions of Berkeley's YACC on the TinyCOBOL grammar,
will result in an abort on a table overflow error.
